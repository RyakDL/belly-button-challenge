Module 14 homework

Overall Comment: I found this Module to be very challenging as I am unfamilar with Javascript. I do see the amazing abilities of JS, however, I work in the commercial banking industry and I don't think I'll need front end developer skills. Instead, understanding SQL, Python, and the many analytical visualizations that are possible in Pandas (matlib, numpy, sklearn seaborn) are most likely what I'll need as a senior credit risk manager. With that said, I completed this module with the aid of my tutor and following along with an example of another student's coding. I do wish that we would have more than one week with JS so that I could become more familar with it, but this was good experience nontheless!
